### 3. Mini-abstract and relevance of [Tempo change study]

This is an article describing the results of a study in human perception of tempo change.  This is important for us so we know what threshold we can alter the beat of a song before it becomes too obvious to the listener.  The results of this article showed that humans perceive tempo changes when the tempo is altered by approximately 8%.
